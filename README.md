ProjectSphere # 🎓 University Project Management System

**Role-Based Web Application for Academic Project Management and Performance Tracking**

## 📌 Project Summary

The **University Project Management System** is a full-stack web application built using **Flask (Python)** for backend and **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for frontend, designed to streamline student project supervision at a university level. It supports **role-based access** for Students, Professors, HODs, and Directors with custom dashboards, centralized analytics, and collaborative features.

## 🚀 Key Responsibilities and Features

- 🔐 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Personalized dashboards for Students, Professors, HODs, and the Director.
- 🧑‍🏫 **Professor Dashboard**: Supervise multiple student projects, monitor milestones, and provide feedback.
- 🏢 **HOD Dashboard**: Access all departmental projects, analyze completion rates and professor involvement.
- 🧠 **Director Insights**: University-wide project tracking with performance analytics and visual metrics.
- 📊 **Analytics & Reporting**: Integrated with **Chart.js** and **Pandas** for visual representation of project data.
- 💬 **Collaboration Tools**: In-app communication system for seamless interactions between students and faculty.

## 🔧 Tech Stack Used

| Category       | Technologies                           |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Frontend       | HTML, CSS, JavaScript                  |
| Backend        | Python, Flask                          |
| Database       | SQLite3, SQLAlchemy ORM                |
| Data Analytics | Pandas, Chart.js                       |
| Version Control| Git, GitHub                            |

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out

- Developed a **centralized project management system** used across multiple departments.
- Implemented **real-time performance monitoring** and **supervision analytics**.
- Delivered a scalable and maintainable Flask architecture following MVC principles.
- Demonstrated team collaboration with clear separation of responsibilities:
  - **Frontend Development**
  - **Backend Development**
  - **Database Integration**
  - **Dashboard and Visualization**
